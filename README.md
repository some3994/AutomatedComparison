To compare two outputs from Vicon Script, run the script ComparisonGeneration.py

To compare outputs from two files (one from Vicon and one from Phil's Code), run the script ComparisonGeneration - Multi-source.py

Currently still in the works to make script that would be the most flexible of them all and can combine and compare multiple outputs at the same time.

The file HC154_results.csv are from outputs from Phil's code and I have also made edits to Phil's code to help with the comparison process, namely changing the actual names of the Joint labels.
